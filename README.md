ROS_OpenLeap
========

This is a proof of concept... but at some point, I think this could be a Kinect killer.

The minimum range on the LEAP Motion sensor is minimal, the FoV is huge, and the price of the sensor is competitive.


Note: as rosmake redirects output, the actual downloading and compilation of my http://github.com/nuclearmistake/OpenLeap library (inlined with the ros build) might half-hide its request for superuser permissions... cd into OpenLeap and run make manually to avoid having these commands be hidden.
